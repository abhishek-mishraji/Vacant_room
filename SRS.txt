Version: 1.2 (Updated – No Floor Selection)
Technology: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL
Date: 1 Sept 2025

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This SRS defines requirements for the Find the Vacant Room Portal.
The system will:

Allow normal users (students/guests) to view room status by selecting only a building.

Allow admins to log in and update room occupancy status.

1.2 Scope

Each building has 10 floors (0–9), 10 rooms per floor → 100 rooms per building.

Class hours are 9 AM – 5 PM, divided into 8 one-hour slots.

Normal users: No login, select a building → view all rooms with status.

Admin: Login → update room status (Vacant/Occupied).

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

Web-based system using PHP & MySQL backend.

User interface with HTML + CSS.
