Problem Statement (Final Version)

Our university has 60 academic buildings, each containing 10 floors (0–9).
Every floor has 10 rooms (numbered 01–10).
Thus, each building has 100 rooms, and across the university there are 6000 rooms in total.

The room numbering format is:

Floor 0 → 001 to 010

Floor 1 → 101 to 110

…

Floor 9 → 901 to 910

Example:

Building 5, Room 407 → means Building 5, Floor 4, Room 07.

⚠️ The Problem

Classes in the university are scheduled between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM.

During this time, classrooms may be occupied by lectures, labs, or events, or they may be vacant.

Currently, there is no centralized system for students to check which rooms are vacant at a particular time.

Students waste time physically searching multiple buildings and floors to find an available room for study, group work, or practice.

The lack of a structured system also causes inefficient utilization of available space.

💡 The Need

A digital platform is required that allows:

Students to instantly check room availability in any building during the class hours (9 AM – 5 PM).

Search and filter by building, floor, room, day, and specific time slot.

Provide a clear visual overview of which rooms are vacant or occupied.

Help administration in monitoring room utilization trends.

🎯 The Goal

The goal is to build a web-based portal using PHP and MySQL that:

Displays the real-time status (Vacant ✅ / Occupied ❌) of all 6000 rooms across 60 buildings.

Handles time slots between 9 AM and 5 PM, showing room availability hour by hour.

Allows easy searching, filtering, and navigation by building, floor, and room number.

Improves student convenience and ensures better usage of university infrastructure.
